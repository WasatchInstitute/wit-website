                    <p class="left-align">Students who are financially unable to pay a required fee may be eligible for a partial or full fee waiver. For a student to be eligible for a fee waiver:
                    </p>
                    <p class="left-align">
                      - The student’s parent/guardian will complete the Fee Waiver Application (Grades 7-12) from the Utah State Office of Education and submit the form to the school office. As soon as the completed forms have been submitted, the fee requirement will be suspended until a final decision has been reached about the student’s eligibility for fee waivers.
                      <br>
                      - The Core Administrative Team will review the fee waiver and approve/deny the fee waiver application.
                      <br>
                      - The parent/guardian will be notified in writing of the decision through the Fee Waiver Decision and Appeal form. If denied, the parent/guardian will be made aware of the possibility of performing community service in lieu of payment of the fee through the Community Service Obligations document.

                      - The parent/guardian may appeal the denial of the fee waiver by submitting a completed appeal form within 10 days of receipt of the Fee Waiver Decision form. This allows the parent/guardian to meet with the Core Administrative Team to appeal the decision. Once the appeal is submitted, the fee requirement remains suspended until a final decision has been reached regarding the appeal.
                      </p>
                      <p class="center-align">Once the fee waiver decision is finalized by acceptance of the fee waiver, agreeing to complete the community service obligation, or through the appeals process, all fee waiver documentation shall be destroyed. Schools may transfer fee waiver eligibility information to other schools to which students advance or transfer. Fee waiver eligibility documentation is NOT required annually but may be required at any time by the school, or a parent may ask for review for good cause.
