                          <p>Attending WIT is a remarkably different experience. To help you see just how different and to make sure you're prepared for the switch, we hold in-person meetings. These events last about an hour and provide a firsthand opportunity to learn about WIT and our philosophy, see our space, meet some of our staff and board members, and see what WIT students did last year. Most importantly, attending this meeting will give you a change to get answers to the questions you have about WIT and verify that WIT would be a good match for you and your student.</p>
