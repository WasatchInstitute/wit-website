Our students have full access to the Utah Transit Authority system, that encompasses most of the valley. Most incoming WIT students are new to public transportation; oftentimes their parents are unfamiliar with public transportation themselves.</p>

                    <p class="center-align">The Utah Transit Authority, or UTA, has received one of the most prestigious awards for public transportation systems in the nation. UTA was awarded transit system of the year due to outstanding service, safety, and cleanliness.</p>

                    <p class="center-align">We have asked some of our students to share their experiences with UTA; click on their names to see what they have to say.</p>

                  <p class="center-align">All Wasatch Institute of Technology students receive a Utah transit Authority Premium Transit pass which they will use throughout the school year. This pass offers unlimited access to TRAX, Frontrunner, and UTA buses (except ski buses). The transit pass is the property of WIT, is non-transferable, and is valid from mid-August to mid-June. Students keep their pass throughout their time at WIT. Replacement passes are available; see the fees page for the current replacement price.</p>

                  <p class="center-align">Parents are required to pay the first month's payment for the pass as part of the student's registration fees; WIT will pay the remaining monthly payments so long as the student remains at WIT.</p>

                  <p class="center-align">Students can use their transit pass throughout the school year for personal use, as well as for school field trips and activities. WIT students need to have their UTA pass with them at all times, as they may be ineligible to attend field trips if they fail to have their pass on the day of the field trip.
