            <p>
            Learning sessions are instructional sessions focused on a specific learning objective(s). These sessions should engage the students in discovering the ideas associated with each objective and the connections between objectives as they apply what they have learned to accomplish meaningful work. Frequently this will be done through problem-based learning and hands-on activities. </p>

            <p>Learning sessions are typically led by a Teaching Team member. The duration of a learning session may be adjusted for each sprint, depending on the time required by the learning objective. Learning sessions are not traditional academic courses, since they regularly cross subject area boundaries and no grade is assigned to the learning session.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col s12 m6">
            <h4 class="center">Work sessions</h4>
            <p>
              Work sessions are periods of focused work during a sprint designed to help students complete their sprint deliverables. Work sessions, often occurring during the last week of the sprint, have been effective for our students as it gives them a chance to improve their work.
           </p>
           <p>
             Students who have already completed their sprint deliverables before the work sessions have opportunities to go on additional field trips or participate in other projects at the school, such as wiring the building, assembling computers, configuring the weather station, or other interesting things.
