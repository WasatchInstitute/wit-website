				By teaching skills required for the jobs of the 21st century, WIT students will form the foundation for tomorrow’s innovation economy. Not only will WIT students graduate with traditional high school diplomas, they will have a tremendous career advantage since they will understand technology well enough to use it in truly innovative ways–thus enabling the true computer revolution.

				The Wasatch Institute of Technology is the brainchild of David Moss, our current School Director. After teaching college-level computer science full-time for nearly a decade, he was baffled by the declining abilities of incoming computer science students. Despite the fact that these incoming students had more exposure to computers than their predecessors, they were less capable of doing anything useful with them. </h4>
				<div class="spacer small" />
				<h4 class="subtitle animatez white">Rather than bemoan the declining capabilities, he worked to establish a computer science-focused high school accessible to as many students as possible. Combining his expertise as a network administrator, software developer, and ScrumMaster, David <a href="">adapted the Agile software development methodology for education</a>. The result is a <span class="main-color">unique learning environment</span> found nowhere else. </h4>
				<div class="spacer small" />
				<h4 class="subtitle animatez white">Based on our core values, WIT is learning laboratory, a place where we can continually try new things, innovate, and iterate as we work to prepare tomorrow's Software Engineers through <em>Next Generation Education</em>.</h4>
