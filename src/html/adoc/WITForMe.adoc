== Computer Science in Other Sectors
Computer science is not just about working for IT companies as big data, software, and the Internet are being integrated into businesses and products throughout society. The knowledge and skills learned from studying computer science prepare students for careers in a variety of sectors, including:

* *Information technology* — designing security software and hardware systems or developing mobile communication devices, networks and applications
* *Manufacturing* — designing and using simulations to improve products
* *Healthcare* — exploring the vast quantities of data produced by new DNA sequencing techniques, developing new remote monitoring systems for patients, or designing security and privacy for medical records
* *Retail* — analyzing data to predict trends and improve inventory management
* *Weather forecasting* — developing and interpreting models that predict the behavior of hurricanes
* *The arts* — designing new special effects for movies or composing digital music
* *Financial services* — designing and overseeing automated trading services

== The Perfect WIT Student
At WIT, we strive for:

* *Maturity*: We are honest, respectful, have a positive attitude, and act responsible beyond our years. This means we don’t make excuses and clean up after ourselves--both literally and figuratively. 
* *Focused*: We will pay attention when necessary or when asked, minimize our digital distractions, and keep ourselves free from negative addictions. 
Seek to understand: We will ask questions and seek help when we are confused or don’t understand. 
* *Committed*: We are dedicated, loyal, and don’t give up--even when it’s hard.
Knows what really matters: We are forward-looking, embrace change, can filter information to identify what is important, and use technology as one tool to help us see the big picture. 
* *Strong work ethic*: We balance work and play, always making sure that we complete the work--even when it’s hard or we don’t want to. 
* *Self-disciplined*: We know what we want to become, are internally motivated, and act morally and ethically. 
* *Knowledgable*: We are teachable and love to learn (even from our mistakes) so we are well-informed and see connections. 
* *Productive*: We take advantage of opportunities to learn and make good use of our time. 
* *Quality of work*: We put in good effort and take pride in our work. We iterate our work so we can better our best. 
* *Well-rounded*: We embrace change, are open to learning new things, and have varied interests. 
* *Critical thinkers*: By objectively evaluating pros and cons, we can break complex problems into smaller solvable steps so we can develop reasonable solutions using our knowledge, skills, creativity, and intuition. 

== Girls in IT
Women are woefully underrepresented in the technology industry–less than 10% of American engineers are female. The same is true for technology education in Utah, where less than 30% of the students were female in the 2010-2011 school year. Nationally, the percentage of women completing undergraduate degrees in computer science has declined sharply in the last two decades, from 37% in 1984 to only 20% in 1999 (Source: eWeek)

.SLCC Computer Science Enrollment By Gender
image::GirlsCS.png["Girls in CS", 300,float="Right",align="Right"]
The number of female students in the Computer Science program at Salt Lake Community College is shrinking–from 16% in in 2003-2004 to just 7% in 2007-2008. What is going on? The reasons include:

* A serious deficiency in educational resources
* Social pressure resulting from the negative social image of scientists and engineers
* A lack of encouragement (coupled with active discouragement
* The dearth of out-of-school science, engineering and technology experiences for girls
* The lack of women role models in the profession

As a school, we wish to increase the number of females involved in information technology by reducing girls’ stereotypes about people who are good in math and science and increase girls’ interest in and commitment to careers in technology, math, science, and engineering.

== What to Expect
The day starts at 8:30 with a fifteen-minute advisory, and then classes begin (including SCOPs). Lunch is from 11:30-12:15, followed by a 15 minute reading session. Classes resume until 3:15, with afternoon advisory and the day ends at 3:30.

WIT curriculum is very fast paced due to our sprint length. You should expect to be responsible for yourself and be able to manage yourself during the sprint. You should expect to do quality work, and strive to make sure that your work is satisfactory, without being told to. You will be expected to be in-charge of making sure your deliverables are completed and fulfill the requirements. Expect to be responsible for your actions, accountable for your grades and behavior, and in-charge of your learning.

== Student Supplies
Students should be prepared for school by bringing:

* Notebooks/Paper
* Writing Utensils
* A Three Ring Binder
* A Reading Book (Kindles are allowed after filling out our use of electronics policy)
* A Laptop or personal Computer (If applicable, not required)

Pencils are available for purchase at the office. Reading books are available to borrow.

== Shadowing
Potential students may visit Wasatch Institute of Technology for a day, before deciding to enroll. Potential students can see how a day a WIT is like, and if it is a right fit for them. They will follow a current student around during the day, receiving information on day to day practices, as well as any exciting events occurring that day. To set up a date for your student to visit, contact us at info@wasatchinstitute.net
