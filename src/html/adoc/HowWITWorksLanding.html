When it started snowing, the school went sledding at Murray Park for the first half of the day. Near Christmas time, the school went to a local Ice Skating Rink, and went Ice Skating for the last several periods of the day. These extra activities help give the students, as well as the teachers, a break from the rigorous sprint curriculum.</p>

Students developed the schools current website, by breaking into coding, writing, video, and photo groups. They learned what it was like to actually develop software and how teamwork is an important part in making sure the process is smooth and quick.</p>
