== Our Future Building 
Our future location will be Daybreak, adjacent the South Jordan Parkway TRAX station. It is a 4 stage project, with plans for multiple buildings, green spaces, and other daybreak amenities. 

The Wasatch Institute of Technology building was designed in partnership with the award-winning architects at Method Studio. Our unique space supports Next Generation Education with its flexible room configurations, smaller classrooms, and abundant opportunities for collaboration. Our building's exterior pays homage to the area's mining history, yet affords breathtaking views of both the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains.
