== WIT's Grading Scale
WIT grades on a numerical scale instead of assigning a letter grade to each class. The scale goes from 0-4, 0 being absolute failure, and 4 being absolute mastery. On average, a student will receive a 2, which means that they can faithfully recreate what happened in the classroom with few to no errors. It means that the student can do the work that would receive an A in a traditional school, and receive a 2. By expanding on what they have learned in the classroom, and applying it to other things that may relate, they can earn a 3. To receive a 4, a student has to show absolute mastery in the concept.
