WIT transportation quotes

Taylor Tanton - I didn't use public transportation very much before. Before using UTA, I tried to avoid it because there could be some weirdos on the train. But now that I ride it every day, it is very safe and there is nothing to worry about. 

Because I hadn't really used it before, I had stereotypes that only bums or weirdos would use it, but there's people just like you riding the train, so there's nothing to be afraid of in riding the train. 

I use my pass all of the time like even when I'm not at school, I go on the weekends and use it. I have a car, but I actually drive to the train station every morning because it saves me so much in gas. 

We get to go on a lot of cool field trips and other opportunities that other schools don't because we have easy access to transportation. 

The location of the school [next to Trax and FrontRunner] is very convenient.

Since being here in Utah, I've never been anywhere on public transportation because if there was anywhere we needed to go it would always be in a car. 

Being young you are kind of dumb with that and you don't really know what's going on and don't know about the hazards of public transportation. 

It is really nice taking the train home. I often spot several regulars, people who are on the same train at the same time every day. It is kind of nice because you can meet them and sometimes they may want to talk a bit and you can get to know them and it's a bit more of a friendly environment that you do get to talk to them.

I didn't use public transportation anywhere near as much as I did now.

Public transportation is really fun because it's not like a school bus where you can only go to school... you can use your pass to go anywhere else.

I never used public transportation prior to attending WIT. I wasn't worried about it and neither were my parents. I've found it easy and convenient to use. I use it to pick up things I buy off of KSL and I can visit my grandma easily.

I would ride Trax occasionally because it was never anything I used, but now I use it all the time. It was kind of expensive at the time and we never took Trax to go downtown or rode the bus. But now I can go and do more things and go with my friends to hang out. I really like public transportation because I feel like I can go almost anywhere, from appointments in Draper, hop on a bus and go almost anywhere in the valley. It almost seems limitless.

I was scared of public transportation and tried to stay away from it. But now I use it a lot, weekends, when we're on break, any time really. As I've gone along, it really isn't that bad. Just because it sounds bad doesn't mean it is. It's just because you don't know. It makes it uneven for the transportation side because you don't have the experience. You won't actually know until you try it.

Cayla & Paije

Paije rode the bus every day, but Cayla thought that public transportation would have been scary, but she rode with a buddy and once you get used to all of the stops, you get used to it.  They go downtown or her grandma's house, or get ice cream at City Creek with other students from WIT. They like the freedom to move about.  I know that almost everywhere you go, there are buddies you can be with on the train from Daybreak to West Valley.

I didn't really use public transportation before, but I enjoy taking Trax every day. My mom rode with me a few times so I could get the hang of it.

I didn't use public transportation before WIT because my mom would take me everywhere. My parents would always say that it was unsafe, but now that I've ridden it I can see that it's not. I even use it outside of school, like for wrestling. It provides a sense of freedom.  I'm not afraid to use it. I used it to go to a BYU football game.

I rode public transportation prior to WIT and never had any problems. I've used it every day since being at WIT, even on weekends to go down to my dad's. It's nice to say "I'll go take the train" so my mom doesn't have to give me a ride. If you were to pay for the full fare every time, it adds up.

I didn't take public transportation before WIT. My parents were concerned that it was going to be dangerous and that I wouldn't be able to find my way to school and they were worried that I would get hurt or something.  Really, it's built a lot of trust between my parents and I because they trust me to go to school. I like it. It's so much cleaner and not as scary as most people think.
