For decades, Arthur Levine, the former president of Teachers College,
Columbia University, has tried to imagine a new kind of institution for
training teachers. He envisions a combination West Point and Bell Labs,
where researchers could study alongside future educators, learning what
works and what's effective in the classroom. That idea is now set to
become a reality.

This week, Levine and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation
announced a $30 million partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology with the goal of creating a better model for teacher
training.

"Instead of focusing on courses and credits students need to take," says
Levine, who's now head of the foundation, "we're going to focus on the
skills and knowledge they need to have to enter the classroom."

The new approach to teacher preparation will focus on what Levine calls
"competencies," not seat time. MIT, which doesn't have a school of
education, will conduct the research to guide the new curriculum and
develop technologies focused on digital learning.

Leine says transparency will be a goal, and the lessons learned shared
with education schools across the country.

"Our hope is that they'll take our ideas, take our practices and adopt
them themselves," says Levine.
