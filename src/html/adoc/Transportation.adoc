== Transit Pass Information
All Wasatch Institute of Technology students receive a Utah Transit Authority Premium Transit pass which they will use throughout the school year. This pass offers unlimited access to TRAX, FrontRunner, and UTA busses (except ski buses). The transit pass is the property of WIT, is non-transferrable, and is valid from mid-August to mid-June. Students keep their pass throughout their time at WIT. Replacement passes are available; see the <<Fees.adoc#replacement fees,fees page>> for the current replacement price.

Parents are required to pay the first month's payment for the pass as part of the student's registration fees; WIT will pay the remaining monthly payments so long as the student remains at WIT. 

Students can use their transit pass throughout the school year for personal use, as well as for school field trips and activities. WIT students need to have their UTA pass with them at all times, as they may be ineligible to attend field trips if they fail to have their pass on the day of the field trip. 

== Students Using Transit
Most incoming WIT students are new to public transit; oftentimes their parents are unfamiliar with public transportation themselves. The Utah Transit Authority received one of the most prestigious awards in public transit. UTA was named Transit System of the year due to outstanding service, safety, and cleanliness. Current WIT students have expressed satisfaction with riding UTA.

I didn't use public transportation very much before. Before using UTA, I tried to avoid it because there could be some weirdos on the train. But now that I ride it every day, it is very safe and there is nothing to worry about. +
Because I hadn't really used it before, I had stereotypes that only bums or weirdos would use it, but there's people just like you riding the train, so there's nothing to be afraid of in riding the train. +
I use my pass all of the time like even when I'm not at school, I go on the weekends and use it. I have a car, but I actually drive to the train station every morning because it saves me so much in gas. +
We get to go on a lot of cool field trips and other opportunities that other schools don't because we have easy access to transportation. +
The location of the school [next to Trax and FrontRunner] is very convenient.

I would ride Trax occasionally because it was never anything I used, but now I use it all the time. It was kind of expensive at the time and we never took Trax to go downtown or rode the bus. But now I can go and do more things and go with my friends to hang out. I really like public transportation because I feel like I can go almost anywhere, from appointments in Draper, hop on a bus and go almost anywhere in the valley. It almost seems limitless.

*_Aaron Graves_* +
I didn't use public transportation before WIT because my mom would take me everywhere. My parents would always say that it was unsafe, but now that I've ridden it I can see that it's not. I even use it outside of school, like for wrestling. It provides a sense of freedom.  I'm not afraid to use it. I used it to go to a BYU football game. 

*_Cameron Sperry_* +
I rode public transportation prior to WIT and never had any problems. I've used it every day since being at WIT, even on weekends to go down to my dad's. It's nice to say "I'll go take the train" so my mom doesn't have to give me a ride. If you were to pay for the full fare every time, it adds up. 

*_Raimond Castillo_* +
I didn't take public transportation before WIT. My parents were concerned that it was going to be dangerous and that I wouldn't be able to find my way to school and they were worried that I would get hurt or something.  Really, it's built a lot of trust between my parents and I because they trust me to go to school. I like it. It's so much cleaner and not as scary as most people think.
