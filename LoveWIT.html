                <br>
                STUDENT EXPERIENCES</h3>
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Overall, student feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for the WIT methods of teaching. Students have all said that they felt listen to and respected by their teachers, compared to their prior school experiences. The most frequently commented on things that students pointed out was the the smaller class sizes allowed for them to have better relationships with both their teachers and their peers, and contributed to the better learning environment.
    </h3>
    <br>        
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Students' favorite field trips have been the Salt Lake County Water Symposium during the Water Sprint, the trip to BYU to hear the founder of Pixar speak, and the play "Is He Dead?" at Hale Centre Theater during the Cycles sprint. Favorite projects have included the cardboard boats during the boat sprint (our first sprint), the crystal radios built in the 1920s sprint, and the science fiction/fantasy short stories written during the space sprint.

            <br>
            SCHOOL CULTURE</h3>
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">The society at WIT is very non-hierarchal. Students are often surprised at the way everyone knows everyone and they help each other out. It's a lot more accepting than the usual school. Bullies aren't even an issue here. Due to the small size, we have a close-knit community that lacks the typical groups you'd get in a regular high school.
     <hr class="hr-line">

            "I'M A WIT STUDENT" PROFILES</h3>
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Cameron H: Coming to WIT is different from most schools, considering all of the content that they offer. I think that the number one reason I came here was the way that they teach. Considering the sprint, I think that, as a hands-on person, the deliverables are a good way to learn. We get a feel for learning that we didn't get anywhere else. We also get a lot of freedom here, considering that we have a lot of privileges. Not abusing them gives you so many possibilities.
    </h3>
    <br>        
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Taylor T: I like being a WIT student. I think this is the first time I have ever actually learned something useful in school. I have experience building computers, and I wanted to expand my knowledge of them, so I came here. I would recommend this school to anyone with an interest in computers or technology.
    </h3>
    <br>        
    <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Sophie B: I'll say right off the bat that I'm not really a computer person. However, that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate WIT. I really do like the sprint system of learning, to teach us things that we would never have even thought about otherwise. Plus, the real-world applications are something that you wouldn't really ever get at your regular public school. And, hey, we go on a lot of field trips and have a great time while still learning. That't a deal breaker, ladies!
    </h3>
        <br>
         <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Jake: I think that WIT, when it started was kind of a mess, but as time went on, it started to flourish and everyone has started to work together better now that we know each other better. Now that we're in a state where we can all work together and be accepting of each other, the learing enviroment is very healthy and we're all doing well. It's not just the students, the teachers are too.
    </h3>
        <br>
         <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Mike: I was really skeptical at first. Well, now that I've been here for a while, WIT has gotten a lot better. I believe that this school teaches well enough that I'll graduate. The skepticism was just me being afraid of the unknown. It's a new school, so I wasn't prepared for any of the teachers or how their teaching styles are different from those at public schools. Now that the teachers and students are adjusted, it's easier to understand the work that we've been given and work together as a team.
    </h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="h3-bodytext">Cameron B: So, WIT. It's a school full of outcasts, and it's a haven for outcasts. It's a place where kids can feel safe due to the fact that everyone does the same thing that they do. Anyway, it's also a place where you can actually feel like you earned that perfect A. It's a place where kids actually earn their grade. I feel like, with as hard as I work and the effort that I put in, I would have had As in public school, but here I've got 2s. WIT is like a place of work rather than a school. We have objectives and requirements to meet. It gives the same atmosphere as a workplace. It makes you want to work harder.
